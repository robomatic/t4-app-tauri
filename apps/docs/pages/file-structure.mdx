# 📁 Understanding the file structure of T4 App

For code within the `/packages/app` and `packages/ui` directory, you can target both web, native, or both at the same time.

## 🎯 How targeting React platforms works in T4 App

For a given file name,

- `.native.tsx` targets Expo/React Native
- `.web.tsx` targets Next.js/React
- `.tsx` is shared across both

Using this approach, T4 app can share as much code as possible between web and native, while still allowing for platform specific code.

## ➕ How to add a new screen

1. Create a new folder in `/packages/app/features` with your screen name.

2. Create a new file in the folder called `screen.tsx`.

3. Import the screen in your `next.js` and `expo` projects.
